This code defines a function **createIncrement**. The function has a **_count_** variable, a **_message_** string, and two functions **_increment_** and **_log_**. The **createIncrement** function returns an array containing two functions **_increment_** and **_log_**.

Next, the **createIncrement** function is called and the result(an array of two functions) is destructured into **increment** and **log** variable.

When **createIncrement** is called, it initializes **_count_** to **_0_** and **_message_** string is create with **_Count is 0_**.

Then, increment function is called 3 times. The increment function have access to count variable as it is in its **lexical scope**. Hence, each time the increment fucntion is called, the value of count is incremented by 1.

After 3 increment calls, the value of count is incremented **_3_**.

Then, the log function is called. Once again, the log function also retains the access to message variabl as it falls under its lexical scope. So, the **_log_** function prints/ logs into console - **_Count is 0_**.

Although the value of count is 3, the message was already assigned **_Count is 0_** string when createIncrement was called.
